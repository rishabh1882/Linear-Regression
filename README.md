# Linear-Regression
Welcome to the Linear Regression Model Implementation repository! This project showcases a simple yet powerful linear regression model built using ython. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method for predicting a continuous outcome based on one or more predictor variables. In this repository, you'll find the source code, dataset used for training, and comprehensive documentation to understand and implement linear regression.

## Key Features:

Clean and Modular Code: The implementation is organized into clear and modular code, making it easy to comprehend and extend.

Customizable: You can easily adapt the model to your specific use case by tweaking parameters or incorporating your own dataset.

Jupyter Notebooks: Explore interactive Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the model development, training, and evaluation process step by step.

Documentation: Detailed documentation provides insights into the underlying principles of linear regression, helping both beginners and experienced practitioners.
